                    <p>The history of Bugatti begins in 1909 when Ettore Bugatti founded his company in Molsheim, in present-day France. Bugatti quickly became known for its innovations in automotive design and its racing cars. The first Bugatti, the Type 10, already shows the signs of technical excellence that will define the brand.</p>
                    <p>In the 1920s, Bugatti gained a reputation with its legendary racing cars, such as the Type 35, which would win over 1,000 races in the decade and become one of the most victorious cars in the history of motorsport.</p>

                    <p>In the 1930s, Bugatti continued to impress with iconic models such as the Bugatti Type 57, considered an automotive work of art. The Type 57SC Atlantic version, with its aerodynamic lines and top performance, became a symbol of luxury and speed.</p>
                    <p>In addition to racing cars, Bugatti also became known for its luxurious and fast road cars, attracting a wealthy clientele from around the world.</p>

                    <p>After World War II, Bugatti faced financial difficulties. Ettore Bugatti passed away in 1947, and without his leadership, the company struggled to regain its pre-war prestige. The production of new models slowed significantly, and the company faced changes in the automotive industry that favored more modern and less expensive cars to produce.</p>
                    <p>The last model produced under Ettore Bugatti's supervision, the Type 101, was launched in the 1950s, but it failed to save the brand from its economic troubles.</p>

                    <p>After decades of inactivity, Bugatti experienced a revival in the late 1980s when an Italian entrepreneur, Romano Artioli, relaunched the brand in 1987. In 1991, Bugatti unveiled the Bugatti EB110, a revolutionary supercar with a V12 engine and four turbos, allowing Bugatti to return to the automotive forefront.</p>
                    <p>In 1998, Volkswagen acquired the Bugatti brand and launched an ambitious project to produce the fastest and most luxurious car in the world.</p>
