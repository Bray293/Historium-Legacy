                    <p>The story of Audi begins in 1909 when August Horch, a German automotive engineer, founded the Audi company after leaving his first enterprise, Horch. The name "Audi" is the Latin translation of "Horch," which means "listen" in German.</p>
                    <p>Audi's first car, the Audi Type A, was produced in 1910. From the very beginning, Audi distinguished itself with technical innovations and a strong commitment to motorsport, with victories in the famous Austrian mountain race.</p>

                    <p>In 1932, Audi merged with three other German car manufacturers: Horch, DKW, and Wanderer to form Auto Union, symbolized by the four rings of Audi's logo. Auto Union became a major player in luxury cars and motorsports, notably with the famous "Silver Arrows" that dominated Grand Prix competitions.</p>
                    <p>Despite its success on the racetrack, World War II interrupted Audi's activities, and Auto Union's factories were heavily damaged.</p>

The introduction of the Audi 100 in 1968 marked the beginning of a new era, with a focus on performance, quality, and technological innovation.</p>
                    <p>Audi's lineup continued to grow with models like the Audi 80, establishing Audi as a premium car brand.</p>
