                    <h1>The Beginnings of BMW<br>(1910s-1930s)</h1>
                    <p>BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke) was founded in 1916 in Munich, Germany. Originally, the company
                        produced aircraft engines, but after World War I, it transitioned to manufacturing motorcycle
                        and car engines. In 1923, BMW launched its first motorcycle, the R32, marking its entry into the
                        automotive industry.</p>
                    <p>BMW quickly gained a reputation for quality and reliability, laying the groundwork for its future
                        success in cutting-edge automotive engineering.</p>

                    <h1>The Interwar Period<br>(1930s-1940s)</h1>
                    <p>In the 1930s, BMW expanded its range of vehicles, turning to luxury cars and sports cars. The BMW
                        328, launched in 1936, quickly became one of the most iconic cars of the time due to its
                        performance and design. However, World War II disrupted production, and the company was forced
                        to refocus on aircraft engines.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the war, BMW suffered heavy losses, and its factories were largely destroyed.</p>

                    <p>After World War II, BMW struggled to rebuild, and in 1952, the company introduced the Isetta, a
                        compact bubble car that became a symbol of post-war mobility. The Isetta helped stabilize BMW’s
                        finances and allowed the company to invest in developing more innovative vehicles.</p>
                    <p>In the 1960s, BMW launched the 1500, which marked the beginning of the “New Class” of cars. This
                        model was instrumental in establishing BMW as a leading manufacturer of premium vehicles.</p>
