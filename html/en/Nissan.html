                    <h1>The Beginnings of Nissan<br> (1910s-1930s)</h1>
                    <p>The history of Nissan dates back to 1911, when Masujiro Hashimoto founded the Kwaishinsha Motor
                        Car
                        Works in Tokyo, Japan. It was in 1914 that the company produced its first car, named
                        DAT (an acronym for Den, Aoyama, and Takeuchi, the three main investors). This car
                        was a compact model designed to meet the growing demand for vehicles in Japan.</p>
                    <p>
                        In 1931, a smaller version of the DAT car was released under the name DATSON,
                        literally "the son of DAT." However, the name was quickly changed to Datsun in 1933, as
                        "son" in Japanese also means "loss." That year, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. was officially created.

                    <h1>Nissan During and After World War II<br>(1940s-1950s)</h1>
                    <p>During World War II, Nissan diverted part of its production to meet the military needs of Japan.
                        After the war, Nissan rebuilt itself and resumed the production of civilian cars.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the 1950s, Nissan collaborated with Austin Motor Company in the UK to produce vehicles under
                        license, which helped the brand improve its manufacturing techniques and modernize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the first cars from this era was the Nissan Patrol (1951), a rugged all-terrain vehicle
                        that marked Nissan's entry into 4x4s.

                    <p>In the 1960s, Nissan began exporting its cars massively internationally, notably to the United
                        States, under the Datsun brand. In 1966, Nissan merged with Prince Motor Company, adding popular
                        models like the Skyline to its portfolio.</p>
                    <p>
                        One of the standout models from this period is the Datsun 240Z (1969), a revolutionary sports
                        car that achieved immense success in the United States and beyond for its combination of
                        performance and affordability. This model established Nissan's reputation in sports cars.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1973, the Datsun Cherry was launched, becoming one of the first Nissan cars to be sold en
                        masse internationally.</p>

                    <p>The 1980s were marked by a rebranding of the company. Nissan decided to gradually phase out the
                        Datsun name in favor of the Nissan brand globally. It was in 1983 that Datsun officially
                        disappeared from the market.</p>
                    <p>
                        During this period, Nissan produced some of the most iconic models in its history:

                        <li>Nissan 300ZX (1983), a sports car that continued the Z lineage and was famous for its
