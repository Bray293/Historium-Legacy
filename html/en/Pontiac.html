                    <p>Pontiac's history began in 1926 as a division of General Motors (GM) with the Pontiac Six model, 
                        an affordable car aimed at filling the gap between GM's entry-level and luxury models. The brand 
                        quickly gained popularity due to its good value for money.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the 1930s, Pontiac distinguished itself with reliable and stylish cars, cementing its reputation 
                        in the American automobile industry.

                    <p>After World War II, Pontiac began focusing on performance with more powerful engines and bolder 
                        styling. The flagship model of this era was the Pontiac Chieftain (1949), marking a turning point 
                        with its modern design.</p>
                    <p>
                        It was during this period that Pontiac started to associate its image with high-performance cars,

                        often regarded as the first "muscle car" in history. With its powerful V8 engine and aggressive 
                        design, the GTO became an icon of American car culture.</p>
                    <p>During this decade, other iconic models such as the Pontiac Firebird (1967) were introduced, 
                        cementing Pontiac as a major player in the high-performance car segment.</p>

                    <p>In the 1980s, Pontiac tried to adapt to new emission regulations and the energy crisis. Despite this, 
                        the brand continued to produce performance models like the Pontiac Trans Am (1982), notably made 
                        famous by the TV series **Knight Rider**.</p>
                    <p>The brand also introduced the Pontiac Fiero (1984), a small mid-engine sports coupe, although its 
                        production was short-lived.</p>

                        evolved. The launch of the Pontiac Aztek (2001), though innovative in concept, was a commercial 
                        failure. Despite this, Pontiac continued to produce appreciated models like the Pontiac G8 (2008), 
                        a high-performance sedan.</p>
                    <p>In 2009, facing the financial crisis and General Motors' restructuring, it was decided to discontinue 
                        the Pontiac brand, which officially ceased operations in 2010.</p>
