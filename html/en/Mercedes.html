                    <p>Mercedes-Benz traces its roots to the revolutionary inventions of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler. In 1886, Karl Benz invented what is often considered the world's first car, the Benz Patent Motorwagen. At the same time, Daimler developed his own internal combustion engine.</p>
                    <p>In 1926, Benz's and Daimler's companies merged to form Daimler-Benz, giving birth to the Mercedes-Benz brand, named after the daughter of one of Daimler's associates, Emil Jellinek.</p>
