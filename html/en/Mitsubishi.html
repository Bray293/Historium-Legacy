                    <h1>The Beginnings of Mitsubishi<br> (1870s-1910)</h1>
                    <p>Mitsubishi was founded in 1870 by Yataro Iwasaki under the name **Mitsubishi Shokai**, a maritime transportation company. The company later diversified its activities to include sectors such as manufacturing, shipbuilding, and automotive. In 1917, Mitsubishi launched the **Mitsubishi Model A**, the first mass-produced car in Japan, marking its entry into the automotive industry.</p>
                    <p>The name Mitsubishi comes from the Japanese words "Mitsu" (three) and "Hishi" (diamond), referring to the company's famous logo representing three diamonds.</p>
