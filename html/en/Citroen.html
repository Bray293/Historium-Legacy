                    <h1>The Beginnings of Citroën<br>(1919-1930)</h1>
                    <p>Founded in 1919 by André Citroën, the brand revolutionized the automobile industry with the production of the Citroën Type A, the first mass-produced car in Europe. Inspired by Ford's assembly line methods, André Citroën introduced this innovation in France, making cars more affordable and accessible.</p>
                    <p>Citroën also became famous for bold marketing strategies, such as illuminating the Eiffel Tower with the name "Citroën" in the 1920s, and the famous Citroën Croisières, expeditions through the Sahara and Asia with Citroën vehicles.</p>

                    <h1>Technical and Financial Innovation<br>(1930-1950)</h1>
                    <p>In the 1930s, Citroën took another leap forward with the launch of the Traction Avant in 1934. This car, a pioneer in front-wheel drive and monocoque chassis, redefined the auto industry by offering better handling and safety.</p>
                    <p>Despite these innovations, the brand faced significant financial difficulties. In 1934, Citroën was acquired by Michelin, which helped the company recover. During and after World War II, Citroën gradually resumed operations with new models, such as the Citroën 2CV launched in 1948.</p>

                    <p>The Citroën 2CV became a true popular icon, meeting the needs of a rural France rebuilding after the war. This simple, sturdy, and economical car captivated millions of customers worldwide.</p>
                    <p>In the 1950s, Citroën made waves with the DS, launched in 1955. This futuristic car, with its revolutionary hydropneumatic suspension, aerodynamic design, and technological innovations, represented the pinnacle of Citroën's ingenuity and remained in production for 20 years.</p>

                    <p>Despite the success of the DS, Citroën faced financial difficulties in the 1970s, partly due to the costly development of the Citroën SM and the failure of certain projects. In 1976, the brand was acquired by Peugeot, forming the PSA Peugeot-Citroën group.</p>
                    <p>Citroën rebounded with more accessible models like the Citroën CX, voted Car of the Year in 1975, and the Citroën BX in the 1980s, which was a huge success in Europe. Avant-garde design and innovation remained at the heart of the brand's strategy.</p>
