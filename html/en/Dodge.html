                    <h1>The Early Years of Dodge<br>(1910s)</h1>
                    <p>Dodge was founded in 1900 by brothers John and Horace Dodge in Detroit, Michigan. Initially, the company manufactured parts for other automakers, notably Ford. In 1914, Dodge produced its first car, the Dodge Model 30, which stood out for its robust design and performance. This car marked the beginning of vehicle production under the Dodge Brothers name.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the quality of their vehicles, Dodge quickly became a major player in the American automotive industry, competing with Ford and General Motors.</p>
