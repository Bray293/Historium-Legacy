                    <h1>The Beginnings of Alpine<br>(1950s-1960s)</h1>
                    <p>Alpine was founded in 1955 by Jean Rédélé, a passionate rally driver. His first creation, the Alpine A106, was a lightweight coupe based on the Renault 4CV's mechanics, designed for exceptional performance. Alpine quickly made a name for itself in the racing world thanks to its agile, lightweight cars suited for rallies.</p>
                    <p>Alpine gained fame after victories in various competitions, and the brand earned a strong reputation for its sporty and innovative spirit, reaching new heights with the iconic Alpine A110, launched in 1962, which soon became a legend.</p>
